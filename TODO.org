* Clones Tasks
*** Implement ROM parsing, returning a plist
**** DONE Function parse-rom (pathname) -> plist of attributes
**** DONE Add pathname as an attribute in parse-rom output
**** DONE Finish tests for parse-rom
**** DONE Write docs for exported symbols in ROM module
*** Implement mapper class, then nrom support
**** DONE mapper interface -> get-prg, set-prg, get-chr, set-chr, load-rom
**** DONE add nice docs for mapper module
**** add a pretty printer for mappers?
*** Implement Disassembler
**** DONE Add a nice instruction reference
**** DONE Add a simple memory interface fetch/store, just RAM and mapper for now, 0s if doing other I/O
**** DONE Write tests for the memory interface
**** DONE Add opcode-data
**** DONE Build opcode table from instruction-data. Can this be shared with CPU? array of opcode structs
***** Opcodes: name, access pattern, code, bytes, cycles, addressing mode. Skip docs?
***** Access pattern: static/jump/read/write/rmw
**** DONE Build disassembler skipping arg formatting, just hex bytes
*** Stream Warmup
**** DONE Fix unbound pathname in default mapper / nestest
**** DONE Convert uses of initform to default-initargs
**** DONE Build out a correct arg formatter for the different addressing modes. Maybe use trivia/defunion?
**** DONE Measure build-opcode-table consing. Export *opcode-table* var instead of rebuilding on demand
**** TODO Write tests for the disassembler. Adding a stream keyarg would help.
*** Implement CPU
**** DONE Add conditions for addressing-mode-not-implemented, opcode-not-implemented, opcode-not-found
**** DONE Add a CPU structure with correct default values and slots
**** DONE Add a nestest harness in clones.test.cpu
**** DONE Add a function single-step(cpu) that dispatches to an appropriate handler for the opcode
**** TODO Should we get the operand for an instruction in single-step or the individual handlers?
**** TODO Implement a bunch of instructions! Watch out for read-modify-write nonsense
**** TODO Add support for working with status register in terms of status keywords like :interrupt :carry etc
**** TODO Ponder storing the size of an opcode's args rather than the opcode AND args. Do we ever need both?

* External dependencies
** DONE Add support for sourcehut URIs to mgl-pax?
