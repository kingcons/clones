(more notes on ppu logic)

you can think of bits 0,1,2,3,4 of the vram address as the "x scroll"(*8)
that the ppu increments as it draws.  as it wraps from 31 to 0, bit 10 is
switched.  you should see how this causes horizontal wrapping between name
tables (0,1) and (2,3).

you can think of bits 5,6,7,8,9 as the "y scroll"(*8).  this functions
slightly different from the X.  it wraps to 0 and bit 11 is switched when
it's incremented from _29_ instead of 31.  there are some odd side effects
from this.. if you manually set the value above 29 (from either 2005 or
2006), the wrapping from 29 obviously won't happen, and attrib data will be
used as name table data.  the "y scroll" still wraps to 0 from 31, but
without switching bit 11.  this explains why writing 240+ to 'Y' in 2005
appeared as a negative scroll value.
